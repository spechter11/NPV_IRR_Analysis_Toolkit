# NPV_IRR_Analysis_Toolkit

## Description

A specialized Python toolkit for in-depth NPV and IRR analysis developed by [@spechter11](https://github.com/spechter11). The toolkit offers various features like calculating Net Present Value, computing the Internal Rate of Return, and generating NPV profile plots for financial projects.

## Features

- Precisely calculate Net Present Value (NPV) for a series of cash flows
- Accurately compute Internal Rate of Return (IRR) based on cash flows
- Visualize NPV profiles for a range of discount rates
